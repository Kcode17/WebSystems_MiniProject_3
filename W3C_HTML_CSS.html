            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language is a standard for language for creating web pages. It describes the structure of a web page. HTML elements have a starting tag with some content and an ending tag. (Ex: <code> &lt;p&gt; This is a paragraph &lt;/p&gt; </code>)</p>
            <p>Following things can be done using HTML</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make web pages with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.</li>
                    <li>Navigate to other webpages via hypertext links, at the click of a button.</li>
                    <li>Design forms for making transactions with remote services for searching information, book tickets, ordering products etc.</li>
                    <li>With HTML, we can include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips on web pages.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>CSS - Cascading Style Sheets are responsible for the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites, share style sheets across pages.</p>
            <p>Few benefits of using CSS</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Easier to maintain and update styles - Basic idea of CSS is to separate the structure from the presentation of the webpages and CSS enables that. And making changes in CSS files will make changes to all those places where the particular CSS was used, thereby optimizing the workflow.</li>
                <li>Faster Webpage download - Using CSS, reduces code behind webpages and helps the page to download faster. As the CSS file is separate, it is cached in the browser after opening the page for the first time, doesn't need to download again and again.</li>
                <li>Consistent Design - As the CSS is used in common for many elements, the page design stays consistent overall.</li>
            </ul>
