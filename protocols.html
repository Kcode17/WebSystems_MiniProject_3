            <h3>HTTP</h3>
            <p>HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol</p>
            <p>HTTP is a protocol which allows fetching of HTML documents over the internet. It enables the communication or data exchange on the web.It is a client-server protocol, means requests are raised by client system(web browser) and responses to those requests are received by client from a server.
                It is used to not only fetch hypertext documents, but also images and videos or to post content to servers, like with HTML form results. HTTP can also be used to fetch parts of documents to update Web pages on demand.</p>

            <p>Web Server</p>
            <p>There is a server, which serves the document as requested by the client. A server appears as a single machine but it might be a collection of different servers.
               Few Functions of a web server - stores and secures website data,serve client requests, bandwidth controlling to regulate traffic. </p>
            <p>Web browsers send get requests to web servers to get html pages back to the web browser. Ex: GET google.html and the browser loads up the html page and shows it to the user. Sometimes, user also posts data to server.Example: When a user wants to login to a particular site like facebook, user inputs a username and a password and these details as posted to a webserver and the server authenticates and recognizes the user and send back the correct html pages for the user.There is also something called cookies which the web browsers send along with the html pages, this is to recognize that a particular request has come from an individual who has already logged in, so the user doesn't have to login again. HTTP is like a language in which the client and the server talks to each other in the form of requests and responses.</p>
