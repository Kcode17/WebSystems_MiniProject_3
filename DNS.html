            <h3>What are Domain Name System?</h3>
            <p>Domain Name Systems is like a phonebook for the web. Users access websites using URLs like www.facebook.com, www.google.com etc. Web browsers work with IP addresses. Domain name system has a mapping with the domain name and its corresponding ip. Basically translates domain name to ip address.
            Every device connect to internet has a unique ip address through which other devices can locate and interact. IP address are numbers which are hard to remember for humans, so DNS eliminates this step of remembering IPs.</p>

            <h3>How Domain Name System works?</h3>
            <p>DNS resolution involves converting a domain name like www.facebook.com to a web friendly ip address (Ex: 123.123.123.12). Its is like an address where the particular page can be located similar to a home address is required to find a house.</p>

            <h3>DNS Spoofing</h3>
            <p>DNS spoofing involves a hacker putting a fake DNS entry in the DNS. When a user requests for a real website, it gets diverted to open the fake website due to the fake entry. Once if the user tries to login, these credentials are captured along with any other sensitive information.</p>
            <p>DNSSEC - Domain Name System Security is a protocol created to secure the DNS.The protocol creates a unique cryptographic signature stored alongside your other DNS records, e.g., A record and CNAME. This signature is then used by your DNS resolver to authenticate a DNS response, ensuring that the record wasnâ€™t tampered with. (Source:imperva.com)</p>
